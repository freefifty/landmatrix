## Exploration of LandMatrix land deal [data](http://landmatrix.org/en/)  
  
Initial work:  

1. Cleaned and processed original csv data - only the first 128 entries    
2. Loaded data  
3. Started exploration  
 - visually highlighted all countries who invested in land over the world  
4. Mapping each country with its central coordinates  
 - the csv data for that is taken from [here](http://gothos.info/2009/02/centroids-for-countries/)  
  
Current TODO:  
  
 - split investor_countries when they are more than one  
 - create arches from investor_country to lender_countries  
 - start writing a second blog in freefifty.github.io  
 - color intensity to indicate number of deals  
 - legend: data + next steps  
 - some country coordinates are [NaN, NaN]?
